| Counts out if a single word in a string matches one word in a string of multiple words. | "any", "match any" | 1 match |
| Counts out if a single word in a string matches multiple words in a string of multiple words. | "any", "any match any" | 2 matches |
| Counts out if a single word in a string matches multiple words in a string of multiple words despite case differences. | "Any", "any match any" | 2 matches |
